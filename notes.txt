1. One of the pattern runtime i noticed is that the bigger the array the faster pushes and the slower it unshift. 
whereas the tiny array the unshift is faster than the push. This happens because the time complexity of push is 0(1) 
it adds a new index at the ending of the array and unshift is 0(n) it has to change the index for every item in the array
the longer the array the longer it will take.
